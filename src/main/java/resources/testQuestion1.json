	"body": "I'm trying to understand how this class could be changed to an immutable one.In particular, I don't see how the boolean field isConnected could be made final, since it represents the connection state.All clients of ConnectionMonitor should just query  isConnected() to get the connection state. I'm aware that locking changes to isConnected is possible or using an atomic boolean. But I don't see how to rewrite this to an immutable class."
