But if you have a listener on the <em>UserRegistered</em> event, then the email can be triggered out of that event. I really like this way of build applications as it makes them more decoupled, but, depending what event dispatcher you use, it becomes more difficult to understand the flow (e.g. if the event dispatcher receives a string as the event name and a map with the data, then is difficult to easily get a list of all consumers).</p>\n\n<p>One important aspect (or I should say smell) is that 2 listeners that are listening for the same event shouldn't depend on the order they consume the event. This applies to all event dispatchers, not just the one implemented by Spring.</p>\n"
