	"body": "If immutable objectsÂ¹ are good, simple and offer benefits in concurrent programming why do programmers keep creating mutable objects? I have four years of experience in Java programming and as I see it, the first thing people do after creating a class is generate getters and setters in the IDE (thus making it mutable). Is there a lack of awareness or can we get away with using mutable objects in most scenarios? "
